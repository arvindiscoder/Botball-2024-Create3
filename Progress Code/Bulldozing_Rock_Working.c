// First we create function called onewheelturnleft this a function we create
//so that the wombat stops one wheel and turns left because
// the left function would cause the wombat to hit the pvc pipe and ruin our code
void onewheelturnleft(){
    // We are using mav to move forward in one direction and stay still in the other direction for a certain distance with an msleep function so that it turns
    mav(0,950);
    mav(3,0);
    msleep(2500);
}
// We create the same thing as above but instead made it turnright because of the same problem, which is it breaks the code and turns wrong and hits pvx pipes
void onewheelturnright(){
    // We are using the mav function to make move forward in one direction and stay still in the other direction, for a certian amount of time
    mav(0,0);
    mav(3,950);
    msleep(2500);
}
// Then we have our square up code so that it can correct itself using the color sensors so that it straightens up
void squareup_working(){
    // We have a grey value which is the average of white value and black so that we can tell that when it is greater then the value it is on black and when it is lower then the value it is on right
    int grey = (3700+4000)/2;
    int right = 4; // The sensor on the right
    int left = 5; // sensors on left 
    int mright = 0; // right motor
    int mleft = 3; // left motor
    while (analog(4)<grey || analog(5)<grey){ // makes robot move until it reaches the black line.
        if (analog(right)<grey){ // if right sensor is not on the balck line we want it to move forward
            mav(mright, 500);
        }else{
            mav(mright,-250); //when it is on the line we want it to turn so that the other one can come in the line to.
        }
        if (analog(left)<grey){ // if left sensor is not on  line it moves forward
            mav(mleft,500);

// then we have a drive function, we have it because it makes reaching a certian distance more exact, we have the two parameters needed like distance we want it to go and speed at we want it to go at.

    // We first clear the motor position so it is 0 so that it does not give false readings
    clear_motor_position_counter (0);

// Then we have a right function, we are working on making it use parameters, but for now we have this amount of turn.

// Then we have a left function which is simmilar to the right function, everything is the same except it turns left instead of right
void left(){
    mav(0,950);
    mav(3,-950);
    msleep(1250);
}
// Then we have the is black function, we are working in incorparating more parameters in so that it is more easier to use but right now the main idea is that it first checks if the analog number is greater then the white value, if it it returns 1, else it will return 0 because it is on white.

// Now we have our line follow code, which is neccesary for the run. We created three parameters to ask how far we want it to go, how fast we want to go, and how drastice of a turn do we want to take.

    // then we state that if the right motor is not equal to the distance we want it to use the isblack function.
    while(gmpc(3)<distance){
        // The way the isblack function helps is it first need a parameter call pint to see what port we arch checking then we look at the return values, so like for an example if it returns 0 it is on white and we want it to move forward.
        if(isblack(4) == 0 && isblack(5) == 0){

        }// If it is equal to one whcih means it is on black we want the motor that is not on black to move forward and the motor that is on black to backward so that we get a turn and the other can get in the black line
        if(isblack(4) == 0 && isblack(5) == 1){
            mav(0,speed); // Again we are going at speed
            mav(3,speed-subtraction);// Then we are subtracting a speed, with a number that is defined when we call the function
        }
        // Simmilar here except now the other on is black so the left motor has to move forward
         if(isblack(4) == 1 && isblack(5) == 0){

// Since we do not have parameters in the right function yet we created a new one called extra right so that we can turn right much longer then the other one
