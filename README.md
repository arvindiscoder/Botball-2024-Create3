                  Our Experience With Github In Botball
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughtout our Botball journey we have added our files to GitHub. Github is so impressing because in GitHub all you have to do is upload files and boom it is saved.<br />
On top of that if you made a big mistake all you have to do is go to Gihub and either copy and paste the code, or you can git clone the repo, and have all the code you added back on your local computer. <br />
This has proven useful in many scenario's, once we made a mistake that pretty much ruined our whole code. Luckily we made a copy and uploaded it to GitHub and that saved us boatloads of time. <br />
Github is such a powerful resource, and will probably be used for the rest of our lives, and the fact that Botball incorperates this into their documentation is very helpful. <br />
