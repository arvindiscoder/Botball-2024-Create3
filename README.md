                  Our Experience With Github In Botball
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughtout our Botball journey we have added our files to GitHub. Github is so impressing because in GitHub all you have to do is upload files and boom it is saved.<br />
On top of that if you made a big mistake all you have to do is go to Gihub and either copy and paste the code, or you can git clone the repo, and have all the code you added back on your local computer. <br />
This has proven useful in many scenario's, once we made a mistake that pretty much ruined our whole code. Luckily we made a copy and uploaded it to GitHub and that saved us boatloads of time. <br />
Github is such a powerful resource, and will probably be used for the rest of our lives, and the fact that Botball incorperates this into their documentation is very helpful. <br />

                  Working With the Wombat
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main branch is for Wombat Code. Speaking of the Wombat, our experience with the Wombat was pretty positive. The Wombat is a great robot, and is our main point maker. The wombat is easy now but it was not always that way. <br />
When we started with the Wombat it was so confusing, we had no clue what did what and how it even worked. Thanks to the Kipr team we ended up understanding how it works, and what the wombat really is. <br />
The Wombat, uses external sensors that need to be installed, so we started installing sensors reading the text to see what it does. We soon ended up figuring what sensors were useful, and what sensors were not useful. <br />
There was a whole lot of bugs, because it was our first time we were all stumped, but thanks to the amazing resource called YouTube we were able to figure out what is going on. After a month we got really good at the wombat. <br />
We knew how to access sensors and how to use them properly. Overall it was a learning curve but it was a hundred percent worth it, because we were able to achive what we wanted to do, and get points in the process. <br />
