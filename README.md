                  Our Experience With Github In Botball
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughtout our Botball journey we have added our files to GitHub. Github is so impressing because in GitHub all you have to do is upload files and boom it is saved.<br />
On top of that if you made a big mistake all you have to do is go to Gihub and either copy and paste the code, or you can git clone the repo, and have all the code you added back on your local computer. <br />
This has proven useful in many scenario's, once we made a mistake that pretty much ruined our whole code. Luckily we made a copy and uploaded it to GitHub and that saved us boatloads of time. <br />
Github is such a powerful resource, and will probably be used for the rest of our lives, and the fact that Botball incorperates this into their documentation is very helpful. <br />

                  Working With the Create3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This branch is for the Create Three, although the Wombat was pretty easy, the Create 3 was not. Our Create Three coders had so many difficulties with the Create Three. The first problem was that the wombat would randomly disconnect from the Create Three. 
It took us a bunch of time before we understood how to reconnect the Create 3 to the wombat, how to deal with random reboots, and etc. <br />
Another problem was the Create Three sensors misreporting, the Create Three sensors would give us random values that did not match what it was supposed to match, so when we accesed the sensors the code would work, and then not work because the sensors<br />
would misreport. This resulted in lots of problems, and the Create Three became an unreliable robot. Luckily we figured out that one sensor was working and we used that one for our gameplan. <br />
We ended up adding other sensors that were correct to make the robot work, and after a lot of time, frustration, and effort we were able to make the Create Three work well. <br /><br />


      Special Thanks To Mr. Tim For Helping Us With The Create Three!!!
